                    More than 60% of Canadian households own at least one pet. 
                    However, finding veterinary care, identifying pet symptoms, 
                    and the ability to face emergencies are important problems.

                <h4>
                    Therefore, the goal of this project is to design a digital platform
                     (mobile app) that centralizes vet reviews, 
                    provides clinic opening hours, and has reliable resources for pet care.

                    In this project, we’ve done online research, interviewed pet owners, 
                    developed ideas using our persona, created the prototype, and conducted usability testing.

                <h5>Understanding the Problem</h5>
                <h4>
                    Before designing our app, we first did online research to find out the situation 
                    and problems for pet owners in Toronto. After this, we collect user needs 
                    with surveys and interviews. After analyzing the data, we discovered these 
                    three pain points:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Limited availability and long waiting times in veterinary care due to a 
                            large number of pets and a small number of vets.</li>
                        <li>Not having plans and enough information while facing emergencies.</li>
                        <li>Untransparent and high cost when taking pets to clinics.</li>
                    </ol>
                </h4>
            </div>   
            <div id="Users' Situation and Needs">
                <h5>Users' Situation and Needs</h5>
                <h4>
                    To understand more about our users, we made a <a id="persona-btn">persona</a> 
                    (Peter with a cat named Milu), his <a id="empathy-btn">empathy map</a>, and the <a id="asis-btn">As-Is scenario</a>. 
                    One day, at midnight, Peter discovered that Milu seemed to be feeling unwell, 
                    he faced these situations:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Peter cannot identify Milu’s symptoms. When searching on the internet, 
                            he was doubtful and confused about the answers he got.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            He tried to find opening clinics online, but when he arrived, 
                            the clinic was already closed. Peter feels very anxious due to 
                            the inaccurate information.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Although Peter called another clinic for an appointment, 
                            he had to wait 1.5 hours after they arrived, long waiting times 
                            made Peter frustrated and unhappy.
                        </li>

                            Peter needs a way to find reliable information so that he can identify 
                            Milu’s emergency and take the best action.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Peter needs a way to decide on which emergency clinic to go to so that 
                            Milu can receive emergency care when needed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Peter needs a way to be distracted or calm during a clinic visit so that 
                            he will not experience intense emotions of grief and self-blame.
                        </li>

                    To fulfill our need statements, we started brainstorming and came up with many ideas. 
                    Some are absurd such as having a personal pet medication buyer, and others are more 
                    useful including an online platform with licensed vets, providing real-time clinic 
                    info, and having online vets.

                    Although some of them have lower impact or feasibility, we want to keep them at this 
                    stage since they are somewhat achievable and beneficial to pet owners.

                <h4>
                    After deciding which ideas to implement, we made Peter's <a id="tobe-btn">To-be scenario</a>. 
                    The three main changes from the <a id="asis-btn2">As-Is scenario</a> are as follows:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Instead of feeling unsure about the next steps and checking the pet anxiously, 
                            Peter can recall previous information regarding illness symptoms.
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            Peter can look at experts' advice and understand the situation better.

                        <li>
                            Before going to the clinic, Peter can find reviews of clinics 
                            online and decide to visit a trusted one and see availability ahead to avoid waiting.

                <h5>Prototyping</h5>
                <h4>
                    Before creating our prototype, we rethought users’ needs and what could be implemented, 
                    then listed our design goals:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Pet owners can create a pet information log to share their pet’s medical history 
                            to assist vets in identifying symptoms.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Pet owners can acquire information to compare and determine their pet’s condition 
                            without having previous knowledge of specific terminology.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Pet owners can check and see clinic information, such as opening times and wait times, 
                            more accurately and centrally than other online resources.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    Then, we drew the storyboard of three tasks with app screens and users’ actions:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Onboarding Page - users have to create a new account when using the app for the first time.

                        <li>
                            Clinic Info - users can search nearby clinics with details and reviews.

                <h4>
                    Before making our clickable prototype, we did an evaluation by asking our potential users 
                    to try to implement the task with our hand-draw prototype. The feedback we got includes 
                    that they like the static tab bar at the bottom but having icons with text labels will 
                    be better, a back button is necessary when users enter something by mistake, and the 
                    “Info” label is unclear about what information it contains. These gave us some new 
                    ideas including splitting the “Info” section into “Community“ for a discussion board 
                    and “Expert Advice” which contains readings from reliable vets.

                    high-fidelity version that looks good and works well. Finally, we will have a test 
                    run to make sure our app meets the platform's requirements and keep making changes 
                    based on user feedback and interest. This method makes sure that our final product 
                    is not only technically sound but also meets the needs and wants of our users.

                    Working on a UX group project from research to prototyping is a new and 
                    challenging experience for me. I have learned a lot throughout the process and 
                    here are three key takeaways:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Collaboration leads to a better design, especially during the 
                            ideation and prototyping process. With more perspective, we can 
                            have more methods to implement tasks and combine our thoughts 
                            also come up with a better idea.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            User evaluation and testing do not end after designing the final 
                            product. To have a better app that suits users’ needs, we must 
                            listen to their feedback and keep updating it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Don't worry too much about the details. In the beginning, 
                            every time I come up with an idea, I will think deeply about 
                            whether we can implement it. Leaving them for a moment for 
                            inspiration might give a better result.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
