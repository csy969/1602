                <h4><img id="overview-img" src="./img/overview.png" alt="Red Pet App">
                    More than 60% of Canadian households own at least one pet. 
                    However, finding veterinary care, identifying pet symptoms, 
                    and the ability to face emergencies are important problems. 
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    Therefore, the goal of this project is to design a digital platform
                     (mobile app) that centralizes vet reviews, 
                    provides clinic opening hours, and has reliable resources for pet care.

                <h4>
                    In this project, we’ve done online research, interviewed pet owners, 
                    developed ideas using our persona, created the prototype, and conducted usability testing. 
                    Each menber of our team lead one of them, and I an leading the ideation process.

                <h4>
                    We followed the UX design process by IBM. In this case study, there are 5 main sections: 
                    1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

                <h5>Understanging the Problem</h5>
                <h4>
                    Before designing our app, we first did online research to find out the situation 
                    and problems for pet owners in Toronto. After this, we collect user needs 
                    with surveys and interviews. After analyzing the data, we discovered these 
                    three pain points:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Limited availability and long waiting times in veterinary care due to a 
                            large number of pets and a small number of vets.</li>
                        <li>Not having plans and enough information while facing emergencies.</li>
                        <li>Untransparent and high cost when taking pets to clinics.</li>
                    </ol>
                </h4>
            </div>   
        </div>
        <div>
                <h5>Users' Situation and Needs</h5>
                <h4>
                    To understand more about our users, we made a <a id="persona-btn">persona</a> 
                    (Peter with a cat named Milu), his <a id="empathy-btn">empathy map</a>, and the <a id="asis-btn">As-Is scenario</a>. 
                    At midnight, Peter discovered that Milu seemed to be feeling unwell, 
                    he faced these situations:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Peter cannot identify Milu’s symptoms. When searching on the internet, 
                            he was doubtful and confused about the answers he got.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            He tried to find opening clinics online, but when he arrived, 
                            the clinic was already closed. Peter feels very anxious due to 
                            the inaccurate information.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Although Peter called another clinic for an appointment, 
                            he had to wait 1.5 hours after they arrived, long waiting times 
                            made Peter frustrated and unhappy.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                <h4>
                    After going through Peter's experience, we developed three main need statements:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Peter needs a way to find reliable information so that he can identify 
                            Milu’s emergency and take the best action.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Peter needs a way to decide on which emergency clinic to go to so that 
                            Milu can receive emergency care when needed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Peter needs a way to be distracted or calm during a clinic visit so that 
                            he will not experience intense emotions of grief and self-blame.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
