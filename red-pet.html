                    More than 60% of Canadian households own at least one pet. 
                    However, finding veterinary care, identifying pet symptoms, 
                    and the ability to face emergencies are important problems.

                    Therefore, the goal of this project is to design a digital platform
                     (mobile app) that centralizes vet reviews, 
                    provides clinic opening hours, and has reliable resources for pet care.

                    In this project, we’ve done online research, interviewed pet owners, 
                    developed ideas using our persona, created the prototype, and conducted usability testing.
