            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Chi-sihun Yang, an emerging UX designer and 
                software developer. Besides UXD, I have a strong background and 
                 am very passionate about website/app development, data 
                 science, and machine learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have learned a lot about user experience including 
                but not limited to research methods, design concepts, 
                 prototyping procedures, and evaluation methods through 
                projects, lectures, and workshops. I am a good team player and 
                a responsible person who always enjoys collaborating with 
                 others.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my spare time, I like drawing, 3D modeling, and game
                 development. I am also a snowboarding and scuba diving 
                 lover. I enjoy solving complex problems and learning new 
                 skills. I am always looking for new challenges and 
                 opportunities from various areas.
