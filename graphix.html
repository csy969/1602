                <h4>
                    Nowadays, young people have more opportunities to participate in social change by sharing
                    information and joining activism efforts. However, many activists struggle with limited
                    access to reliable information, and face a lack of educational resources and challenges
                    in collaboration - All make it difficult for a meaningful change.
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    Therefore, the Graphix project aims to design a multilingual online platform to empower young
                    adult activists through visual storytelling, comics, and digital media. The goal is to create
                    a space where activists can connect, share knowledge, and amplify their impact
                    globally.
                </h4>
                <h4>
                   To achieve this, we conducted online research, used surveys to learn about
                  activists' engagement, built user flows, and designed clickable prototypes.

                <h4>
                    Before creating surveys and designing the prototype, we did online research about the existing platforms 
                    related to activism, and had conversations with experts in the field. Here are the main problems we identified:
                    <ol>
                        <li>There is <mark>no existing centralized, multilingual platform</mark> where young activists can collaborate effectively across continents.</li>
                        <li><mark>Visual graphics or comics are underutilized</mark> in traditional activist advocacy websites.</li>
                        <li>Existing platforms prioritize social media-driven activism, which <mark>lacks structured educational content and long-term engagement tools</mark>.</li>
                        <li>Activists face barriers such as <mark>information overload, unreliable resources, language & translation difficulties, and security concerns</mark>.</li>
                    </ol>
                 </h4>
                <h4>
                    After this, we decided to use surveys to validate our user needs and identify pain points. In this case, the
                    platform will align with real user behaviors and expectations. Here are the research questions we would like to explore:
                    <ol>
                        <li>What factors affect the young adult's <mark>ability to engage</mark> in activism or learn about human rights issues through online formats?</li>
                        <li>What factors affect young adults' <mark>interest in learning</mark> about human rights through visual storytelling, such as graphics or comics?</li>
                        <li>How’s their <mark>current ability to learn</mark> about different activism topics through online platforms?</li>
                    </ol>
                </h4>
                
                <h4>
                    Through 300+ surveys we collected all across the world, we got these key findings:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The motivations when using online platforms are to <mark>connect with like-minded
                            communities, reach a global audience, and receive real-time feedback</mark>. They seek
                            partners with shared goals, want to amplify their impact, and need timely responses to 
                            assess whether their actions are making a difference.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The top barriers regarding people’s willingness to engage in activism are <mark>privacy and security concerns</mark>, the
                            fear of data leaks and cyber threats, and difficulty finding trustworthy information affect. 
                           Furthermore, due to a <mark>lack of accessible activist networks</mark>, initiating or maintaining collaboration is even more challenging.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When it comes to networking, participants identified <mark>time constraints, language barriers,
                            and difficulty verifying reliable work</mark> as key challenges. Financial limitations are another
                            obstacle to learning human rights topics they want to know about, as well as restricted
                            access to quality learning materials. Information overload makes it difficult for users to
                            navigate vast content, while security concerns prevent trust from building in the form of
                            online learning.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A large part of the participants agree on the effectiveness of graphic use in advocacy.
                            Visual storytelling plays a critical role and they recognized its ability to capture attention,
                            enhance retention, and break language barriers. However, there are concerns about
                            misinterpretation, oversimplification, and lack of depth.
