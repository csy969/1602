                <h4>
                    Nowadays, young people have more opportunities to participate in social change by sharing
                    information and joining activism efforts. However, many activists struggle with limited
                    access to reliable information, and face a lack of educational resources and challenges
                    in collaboration - All make it difficult for a meaningful change.
                </h4>
                <h4>
                    Therefore, the Graphix project aims to design a multilingual online platform to empower young
                    adult activists through visual storytelling, comics, and digital media. The goal is to create
                    a space where activists can connect, share knowledge, and amplify their impact
                    globally.
                </h4>
                <h4>
                   To achieve this, we conducted online research, used surveys to learn about
                  activists' engagement, built user flows, and designed clickable prototypes.

                <h4>
                    Before creating surveys and designing the prototype, we did online research about the existing platforms 
                    related to activism, and had conversations with experts in the field. Here are the main problems we identified:
                    <ol>
                        <li>There is <mark>no existing centralized, multilingual platform</mark> where young activists can collaborate effectively across continents.</li>
                        <li><mark>Visual graphics or comics are underutilized</mark> in traditional activist advocacy websites.</li>
                        <li>Existing platforms prioritize social media-driven activism, which <mark>lacks structured educational content and long-term engagement tools</mark>.</li>
                        <li>Activists face barriers such as <mark>information overload, unreliable resources, language & translation difficulties, and security concerns</mark>.</li>
                    </ol>
                 </h4>
                <h4>
                    After this, we decided to use surveys to validate our user needs and identify pain points. In this case, the
                    platform will align with real user behaviors and expectations. Here are the research questions we would like to explore:
                    <ol>
                        <li>What factors affect the young adult's <mark>ability to engage</mark> in activism or learn about human rights issues through online formats?</li>
                        <li>What factors affect young adults' <mark>interest in learning</mark> about human rights through visual storytelling, such as graphics or comics?</li>
                        <li>How’s their <mark>current ability to learn</mark> about different activism topics through online platforms?</li>
                    </ol>
                </h4>
                
                <h4>
                    Through 300+ surveys we collected all across the world, we got these key findings:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The motivations when using online platforms are to <mark>connect with like-minded
                            communities, reach a global audience, and receive real-time feedback</mark>. They seek
                            partners with shared goals, want to amplify their impact, and need timely responses to 
                            assess whether their actions are making a difference.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The top barriers regarding people’s willingness to engage in activism are <mark>privacy and security concerns</mark>, the
                            fear of data leaks and cyber threats, and difficulty finding trustworthy information affect. 
                           Furthermore, due to a <mark>lack of accessible activist networks</mark>, initiating or maintaining collaboration is even more challenging.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When it comes to networking, participants identified <mark>time constraints, language barriers,
                            and difficulty verifying reliable work</mark> as key challenges. Financial limitations are another
                            obstacle to learning human rights topics they want to know about, as well as restricted
                            access to quality learning materials. Information overload makes it difficult for users to
                            navigate vast content, while security concerns prevent trust from building in the form of
                            online learning.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A large part of the participants agree on the effectiveness of graphic use in advocacy.
                            Visual storytelling plays a critical role and they recognized its ability to capture attention,
                            enhance retention, and break language barriers. However, there are concerns about
                            misinterpretation, oversimplification, and lack of depth.

                <h4>
                    To evaluate how users navigate the website and identify confusion points and areas for improvement, 
                    we conducted a first round of usability testing. The test focused on evaluating the clarity of our navigation, 
                    interface elements, and terminology. The feedback revealed several areas for improvement:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Wording Issues: Participants expressed confusion around certain terms, such 
                            as “Dynamic Map,” “Discussion,” and “Recommendation”, which lacked clear 
                            meaning or actionable purpose. This indicated a need for more intuitive labeling 
                            that better reflects user expectations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            UI & Layout: Text sizes in some areas were too small, and the search bar was 
                            not visually distinct enough from surrounding elements, making it appear more 
                            like a button than a text input field. Additionally, inconsistencies in the footer 
                            layout affected visual flow.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Feature Visibility: Originally, the language switch icon, shown as a globe 
                            symbol, was not easily recognized, and all 4 participants had trouble finding it.
                            Participants preferred a clearer indication, like “(Language)/(Region)” for 
                            language settings. Similarly, the login and sign-up options were not prominent 
                            enough for users to locate quickly.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                   Therefore, we change the navigation bar/category wording, globe icon to Location/Language, and section description
                    , login option, view more button replacement, and feature description. We also wrote a design guideline document 
                    as well as another user testing plan, including interviews and a post-session questionnaire,
                    for future designers and developers to carry this work forward in the platform’s next development phase.

                <h4>
                    The experience of working with actual clients and users is very valuable for me. 
                    I have learned a lot throughout the process, and here are three key takeaways:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Communication is essential in projects, especially when having different perspectives and expectations. 
                            To create a better product, we should listen to others respectfully, then go through and our thoughts
                            carefully to avoid misunderstanding.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To ensure future team members can easily continue to work on the project, 
                            a clear and reusable design file and supplementary documents can provide full support. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Primary user research is very important, especially when the topics are more niche. 
                            With a broad range of participants, including activists, educators, and students, we understand 
                            not only the motivations behind online activism but also the barriers they face, informing a truly 
                            inclusive and globally conscious design direction.
                        </li>
